# Enhanced Collaboration System

## üéØ Overview

This system implements a complete collaboration workflow between influencers and brands with campaign-specific assignments. The system allows influencers to send collaboration requests for specific campaigns, and when brands accept these requests, the data automatically flows from the collaboration requests table to the influencer lists table with proper campaign tracking.

## üöÄ Key Features

### ‚úÖ Complete Workflow
- **Influencers can send requests** for specific campaigns
- **Brands can accept/reject** requests with one click
- **Automatic data flow** from requests to assignments
- **Campaign-specific tracking** for all assignments

### ‚úÖ Enhanced UI Components
- **View Details Modal**: Shows actual campaign assignments
- **Remove Modal**: Allows campaign-specific removals
- **Influencer Cards**: Display collaboration status
- **Search Page**: Handles the complete workflow

### ‚úÖ Database Integration
- **Campaign ID tracking** in influencer_lists table
- **Seamless data migration** from requests to assignments
- **Proper constraints** to maintain data integrity

## üìã System Requirements

- Node.js 16+
- Supabase account
- PostgreSQL database (via Supabase)

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Database Migration

1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to the SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the contents of `server/run-migration.sql`
4. Click "Run" to execute the migration

### Step 2: Test the Migration

```bash
cd server
node test-campaign-id-migration.js
```

### Step 3: Start the Server

```bash
cd server
npm run dev
```

### Step 4: Start the Client

```bash
cd client
npm run dev
```

## üîÑ Workflow

### 1. Influencer Sends Request

```javascript
// Influencer sends collaboration request
const response = await fetch('/api/influencers/send-request', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    influencerId: 1,
    brandId: 1,
    campaignId: 3,
    message: "I'd like to collaborate on your summer campaign"
  })
});
```

### 2. Brand Accepts Request

```javascript
// Brand accepts the request
const response = await fetch('/api/collaboration-requests/1/status', {
  method: 'PUT',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({ status: 'accepted' })
});

// This automatically:
// 1. Adds influencer to influencer_lists with campaign_id
// 2. Removes request from collaboration_requests
// 3. Updates UI to show influencer in selected tab
```

### 3. View Campaign Details

When you click "View Details" on an influencer card in the selected tab, it will show:
- Campaign name and brand
- Campaign platform and status
- Assignment date
- Campaign start/end dates

### 4. Remove from Campaigns

When you click "Remove" on an influencer card:
- Modal shows all campaigns the influencer is assigned to
- You can select specific campaigns to remove from
- Only removes from selected campaigns, not all assignments

## üß™ Testing

### Test the Migration

```bash
cd server
node test-campaign-id-migration.js
```

### Test API Endpoints

```bash
# Test collaboration request creation
curl -X POST http://localhost:5052/api/collaboration-requests \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "senderType": "influencer",
    "senderId": 1,
    "receiverType": "brand",
    "receiverId": 1,
    "campaignId": 1,
    "requestType": "campaign_assignment"
  }'

# Test accepting a request
curl -X PUT http://localhost:5052/api/collaboration-requests/1/status \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"status": "accepted"}'
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Campaign ID Column Missing**
   - Run the SQL migration manually in Supabase dashboard
   - Check that the migration completed successfully

2. **API 404 Errors**
   - Verify server is running on port 5052
   - Check that all routes are registered correctly
   - Ensure environment variables are set

3. **Database Constraint Errors**
   - Check that old constraints were dropped
   - Verify new constraints were added correctly
   - Run the test script to verify setup

### Debug Steps

1. Check database schema:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM influencer_lists LIMIT 1;
   ```

2. Test API endpoints with curl or Postman

3. Check server logs for errors

4. Verify frontend API calls are correct
